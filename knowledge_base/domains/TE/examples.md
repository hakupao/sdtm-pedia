# TE — Examples

Both of the trials in TA Examples 1 and 2 (see Section 7.2.1, Trial Arms) are assumed to have fixed-duration elements. The wording in TESTRL is intended to separate the description of the event that starts the element into the part that would be visible to a blinded participant in the trial (e.g., "First dose of a treatment epoch") from the part that is revealed when the study is unblinded (e.g., "where dose is 5 mg"). Care must be taken in choosing these descriptions to be sure that they are arm- and epoch-neutral.

## Example 1

This example shows the TE dataset for TA Example Trial 1.

| 1 | EX2 | TE | SCRN | Screen | Informed consent | 2 weeks after start of Element | P14D |
| 2 | EX2 | TE | P | Placebo | First dose of a treatment Epoch, where dose is placebo | 2 weeks after start of Element | P14D |
| 3 | EX2 | TE | 5 | 5 mg | First dose of a treatment Epoch, where dose is 5 mg drug | 2 weeks after start of Element | P14D |
| 4 | EX2 | TE | 10 | 10 mg | First dose of a treatment Epoch, where dose is 10 mg drug | 2 weeks after start of Element | P14D |
| 5 | EX2 | TE | REST | Rest | 48 hrs after last dose of preceding treatment Epoch | 1 week after start of Element | P7D |
| 6 | EX2 | TE | FU | Follow-up | 48 hrs after last dose of third treatment Epoch | 3 weeks after start of Element | P21D |

## Example 3

The TE dataset for TA Example Trial 4 illustrates element end rules for elements that are not all of fixed duration. The screen element in this study can be up to 2 weeks long, but because it may end earlier it is not of fixed duration. The rest element has a variable length, depending on how quickly WBC recovers. Note that the start rules for the A and B elements have been written to be suitable for a blinded study.

## Trial Elements Issues

### Granularity of Trial Elements

Deciding how finely to divide trial time when identifying trial elements is a matter of judgment, as illustrated by the following examples:

1. TA Example Trial 2 was represented using 3 treatment epochs separated by 2 washout epochs and followed by a follow-up epoch. This might have been modeled using 3 treatment epochs that included both the 2-week treatment period and the 1-week rest period. Because the first week after the third treatment period would be included in the third treatment epoch, the follow-up epoch would then have a duration of 2 weeks.

2. In TA Example Trials 4, 5, and 6, separate treatment and rest elements were identified. However, the combination of treatment and rest could be represented as a single element.

3. A trial might include a dose titration, with subjects receiving increasing doses on a weekly basis until certain conditions are met. The trial design could be modeled in any of the following ways:
    a. Using several 1-week elements at specific doses, followed by an element of variable length at the chosen dose
    b. As a titration element of variable length followed by a constant dosing element of variable length
    c. One element with dosing determined by titration

### Distinguishing Elements, Study Cells, and Epochs

It is easy to confuse elements, which are reusable trial building blocks, with study cells (which contain the elements for a particular epoch and Arm) and with epochs (which are time periods for the trial as a whole). In part, this is because many trials have epochs for which the same element appears in all arms, and in the trial design matrix for many trials, there are columns (Epochs) in which all the study cells have the same contents. It is also natural to use the same name (e.g., screen, follow-up) for both such an epoch and the single element that appears within it.

### Transitions Between Elements

The transition between one element and the next can be thought of as a 3-step process:

| Step | Step question | How step question is answered by information in the TA datasets |
|------|---|---|
| 1 | Should the subject leave the current element? | The criteria for ending the current element are in TEENRL in the TE dataset. |
| 2 | Which element should the subject enter next? | If there is a branch at this point in the trial, evaluate criteria described in TABRANCH (e.g., randomization results) in the TA dataset. Otherwise, if TATRANS in the TA dataset is populated in this arm at this point, follow those instructions. Otherwise, move to the next element in this arm as specified by TAETORD in the TA dataset. |
| 3 | What does the subject do to enter the next element? | The action or event that marks the start of the next element is specified in TESTRL in the TE dataset. |

Note that the subject is not "in limbo" during this process. The subject remains in the current element until step 3, at which point the subject transitions to the new element. There are no gaps between elements.
