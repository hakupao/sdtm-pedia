# DA — Assumptions

1. This domain records the amount of study product transferred to or from the study subject.
   a. Transfers of devices are not represented in this domain, but in the Device Tracking and Disposition (DT) domain. See the SDTMIG for Medical Devices (available at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/medical-devices-sdtmig/).
   b. For drugs, transfers are usually recorded using the tests "Dispensed Amount" and "Returned Amount".
   c. Test terminology for other products may be different; for example, for nutrition, the tests might be "Prepared Amount" and "Unused Amount".

2. DACAT may be used to differentiate transfers of different groups of products (e.g., rescue medications vs. investigational medications).

3. DAREFID and DASPID are both available for capturing label information.

4. The following qualifiers would not generally be used in DA: --MODIFY, --POS, --BODSYS, --ORNRLO, --ORNRHI, --STNRLO, --STNRHI, --STNRC, --NRIND, --RESCAT, --XFN, --NAM, --LOINC, --SPEC, --SPCCND, --METHOD, --BLFL, --FAST, --DRVRL, --TOX, --TOXGR, --SEV.
