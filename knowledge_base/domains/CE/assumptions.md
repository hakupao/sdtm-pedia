# CE — Assumptions

1. The determination of events to be considered clinical events versus adverse events should be done carefully and with reference to regulatory guidelines or consultation with a regulatory review division. Events of clinical interest as defined by the protocol that are not considered AEs should be reflected as CEs.
   a. Events considered to be clinical events may include episodes of symptoms of the disease under study (often known as "signs and symptoms"), or events that do not constitute adverse events in themselves, though they might lead to the identification of an adverse event. For example, in a study of an investigational treatment for migraine headaches, migraine headaches may not be considered to be adverse events per protocol. The occurrence of migraines or associated signs and symptoms might be reported in CE.
   b. In vaccine trials, certain adverse events may be considered to be signs or symptoms and accordingly determined to be clinical events. If any event is considered serious, then the serious variable (--SER) and the serious adverse event flags (--SCAN, --SCONG, --SDTH, --SHOSP, --SLIFE, --SOD, --SMIE) would be required in the CE domain.
   c. Other studies might track the occurrence of specific events as efficacy endpoints. For example, in a study of an investigational treatment for prevention of ischemic stroke, all occurrences of TIA, stroke, and death might be captured as clinical events and assessed as to whether they meet endpoint criteria. Note that other information about these events may be reported in other datasets. For example, the event leading to death would also be reported as a reason for study discontinuation in the Disposition (DS) domain.

2. CEOCCUR and CEPRESP are used together to indicate whether the event in CETERM was prespecified and whether it occurred. CEPRESP can be used to separate records that correspond to probing questions for prespecified events from those that represent spontaneously reported events, whereas CEOCCUR contains the responses to such questions. The following table shows how these variables are populated in various situations.

   | Situation | Value of CEPRESP | Value of CEOCCUR | Value of CESTAT |
   |-----------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
   | Spontaneously reported event occurrence | | | |
   | Prespecified event occurred | Y | Y | |
   | Prespecified event did not occur | Y | N | |
   | Prespecified event has no response | Y | | NOT DONE |

3. The collection of write-in events on a CE CRF should be considered with caution. Sponsors must ensure that all adverse events are recorded in the AE domain.

4. Any identifier variable may be added to the CE domain.

5. Timing variables
   a. Relative timing assessments "Prior" or "Ongoing" are common in the collection of CE information. CESTRF or CEENRF may be used when this timing assessment is relative to the study reference period for the subject represented in the Demographics (DM) dataset (RFENDTC). CESTRTPT with CESTTPT and/or CEENRTPT with CEENTPT may be used when "Prior" or "Ongoing" are relative to specific dates other than the start and end of the study reference period. See Section 4.4.7, Use of Relative Timing Variables.
   b. Additional timing variables may be used when appropriate.

6. The clinical events domain is based on the Events general observation class and thus can use any variables in the Events class, including those found in the AE domain specification table.
