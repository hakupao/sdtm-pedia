# OE — Assumptions

1. In ophthalmic studies, the eyes are usually sites of treatment. It is appropriate to identify sites using the variable FOCID. When FOCID is used to identify the eyes, it is recommended that the values "OD" (oculus dexter, right eye), "OS" (oculus sinister, left eye), and "OU" (oculus uterque, both eyes) be used in FOCID. These terms are the exclusively preferred terms used by the ophthalmology community as abbreviations for the expanded Latin terms, and are included in the nonextensible CDISC Ophthalmic Focus of Study Specific Interest (OEFOCUS) codelist.

2. In any study that uses FOCID, FOCID would be included in records in any subject-level domain representing findings, interventions, or events (e.g., Adverse Events) related to the eyes. Whether or not FOCID is used in a study, --LOC and --LAT should be populated in records related to the eyes. The value in OELOC may be "EYE" but may also be a part of the eye (e.g., "RETINA", "CORNEA").

3. Any Identifiers, Timing variables, or Findings general observation class qualifiers may be added to the OE domain, but the following qualifiers would not generally be used: --MODIFY, --NSPCES, --POS, --BODSYS, --ORREF, --STREFC, --STREFN, --CHRON, --DISTR, --ANTREG, --LEAD, --FAST, --TOX, --TOXGR, --LLOQ, --ULOQ.
