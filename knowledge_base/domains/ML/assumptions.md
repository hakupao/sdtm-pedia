# ML — Assumptions

1. The ML domain is used to represent consumption of any food or nutritional item that would not be represented in the exposure domains (EC/EX), Concomitant/Prior Medications (CM), Procedure Agents (AG), or Substance Use (SU). Examples of nutritional items that would be represented in other domains include:
   a. Investigational nutritional products (represented in EC/EX)
   b. Food or drink used to treat hypoglycemic events (represented in CM)
   c. Glucose given as part of a glucose tolerance test (represented in AG)
   d. Caffeinated drinks (represented in SU)

   The nutritional items represented in ML may be prospectively defined within a protocol, collected retrospectively as potential precipitants of clinical events, and/or to describe nutritional intake.

2. Additional timing variables
   a. Any additional timing variables may be added to this domain.
   b. Consumption of a food product is considered to occur over an interval of time (as opposed to a point in time). If start and end date/times are collected, they should be represented in MLSTDTC and MLENDTC, respectively. If only a start date/time is collected, it should not be copied to MLENDTC.

3. Any identifier variables, timing variables, or findings general observation-class qualifiers may be added to the ML domain, but the following qualifiers would generally not be used: --MOOD, --LOT, --LOC, --LAT, --DIR, --PORTOT.
