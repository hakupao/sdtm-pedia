# PR — Assumptions

1. Some examples of procedures, by type, include the following:
   a. Disease screening (e.g., mammogram, pap smear)
   b. Endoscopic examinations (e.g., arthroscopy, diagnostic colonoscopy, therapeutic colonoscopy, diagnostic laparoscopy, therapeutic laparoscopy)
   c. Diagnostic tests (e.g., amniocentesis, biopsy, catheterization, cutaneous oximetry, finger stick, fluorophotometry, imaging techniques (e.g., DXA scan, CT scan, MRI), phlebotomy, pulmonary function test, skin test, stress test, tympanometry)
   d. Therapeutic procedures (e.g., ablation therapy, catheterization, cryotherapy, mechanical ventilation, phototherapy, radiation therapy/radiotherapy, thermotherapy)
   e. Surgical procedures (e.g., curative surgery, diagnostic surgery, palliative surgery, therapeutic surgery, prophylactic surgery, resection, stenting, hysterectomy, tubal ligation, implantation)

   The Procedures domain is based on the Interventions observation class. The extent of physiological effect may range from observable to microscopic. Regardless of the extent of effect or whether it is collected in the study, all collected procedures are represented in this domain. The protocol design should specify whether procedure information will be collected. Measurements obtained from procedures are to be represented in their respective Findings domain(s). For example, a biopsy may be performed to obtain a tissue sample that is then evaluated histopathologically. In this case, details of the biopsy procedure can be represented in the PR domain and the histopathology findings in the Microscopic Findings (MI) domain. Describing the relationship between PR and MI records (in RELREC) in this example is dependent on whether the relationship is collected, either explicitly or implicitly.

2. In the Findings Observation Class, the test method is represented in the --METHOD variable (e.g., electrophoresis, gram stain, polymerase chain reaction). At times, the test method overlaps with diagnostic/therapeutic procedures (e.g., ultrasound, MRI, x-ray) in-scope for the PR domain. The following is recommended: If timing (start, end or duration) or an indicator populating PROCCUR, PRSTAT, or PRREASND is collected, then a PR record should be created. If only the findings from a procedure are collected, then --METHOD in the Findings domain(s) may be sufficient to reflect the procedure and a related PR record is optional. It is at the sponsor's discretion whether to represent the procedure as both a test method (--METHOD) and related PR record.

3. PRINDC is used to represent a medical indication, a medical condition which makes a treatment advisable. The reason for a procedure may be something other than a medical indication. For example, an x-ray might be taken to determine whether a fracture was present. Reasons other than medical indications should be represented using the supplemental qualifier PRREAS (see Appendix C1, Supplemental Qualifiers Name Codes).

4. Any identifier variables, timing variables, or interventions general observation-class qualifiers may be added to the PR domain, but the following qualifiers would generally not be used: --MOOD, --LOT.
