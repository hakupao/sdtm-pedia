# TA — Examples

The core of the Trial Design Model is the TA dataset. For each arm of the trial, the TA dataset contains 1 record for each occurrence of an element in the path of the arm.

Although the TA dataset has 1 record for each trial element traversed by subjects assigned to an arm, it is generally more useful to work out the overall design of the trial at the study cell level first, then to work out the elements within each study cell, and finally to develop the definitions of the elements that are contained in the Trial Elements (TE) table.

This section uses example trials of increasing complexity to illustrate the concepts of trial design. For each example trial, the process of working out the TA table is illustrated by means of a series of diagrams and tables, including:

- A diagram showing the branching structure of the trial in a "study schema" format
- A diagram that shows the "prospective" view of the trial (i.e., the view of those participating in the trial), with epochs and elements
- A diagram that shows the "retrospective" view of the trial (i.e., the view of the analyst reporting on the trial), arm-centered showing elements within each study cell
- If the trial is blinded, a diagram showing the trial as it appears to a blinded participant
- A trial design matrix, an alternative format showing arms and epochs with study cells
- The TA dataset

Example 1 should be reviewed before reading other examples, as it explains the conventions used for all diagrams and tables in the examples.

## Example 1

A simple parallel trial with 3 arms (Placebo, Drug A, Drug B), 3 epochs (Screening, Run-In, Treatment). Each study cell contains exactly 1 element. Randomization occurs at the end of the Run-In element.

A crossover trial comparing 3 treatments (Placebo, 5 mg, 10 mg) with 7 epochs: Screening, 3 Treatment Epochs with 3 Rest (washout) Epochs between them, and a Follow-up Epoch. Each arm represents a different order of treatments.

## Example 3

A trial with multiple branches: randomization at screening plus response evaluation after blinded treatment. This results in 4 arms (A-Open A, A-Rescue, B-Open A, B-Rescue). TABRANCH is populated for 2 records in each arm reflecting the 2 branch points.

## Example 4

A cyclical chemotherapy oncology trial with repeating treatment/rest elements until disease progression. 2 arms (Drug A, Drug B), 3 epochs (Screening, Treatment, Follow-Up). The TATRANS variable represents the "repeat until disease progression" skip-forward rule.

Maximum of 4 cycles assumed in this example.

## Example 6

An oncology trial with cycles of different lengths: Drug A in 3-week cycles (longer treatment, short rest), Drug B in 4-week cycles (short treatment, long rest). Maximum 4 cycles of Drug A, 3 cycles of Drug B.

Because the treatment epoch for arm A has more elements than arm B, TAETORD is 10 for the follow-up element in arm A, but 8 for follow-up in arm B. Gaps in TAETORD values are acceptable.

## Example 7

Example Trial 7, RTOG 93-09, involves treatment of lung cancer with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, with or without surgery. This is a complex 2-arm trial (CR = Chemotherapy and Radiation; CRS = Chemotherapy, Radiation, and Surgery) with 4 epochs (Screening, Induction Treatment, Continuation Treatment, Follow-up) and major "skip forward" arrows for disease progression.

Both the induction and additional chemotherapy are given in 2 cycles. The second induction cycle is different for the 2 arms, since radiation therapy for those assigned to the non-surgery arm includes a "boost" which those assigned to the surgery arm do not receive.

Same epoch structure as the Prospective View. The elements in the Continuation Treatment Epoch for the CR arm do not fill the space compared to the CRS arm, reflecting different treatment durations between the 2 arms.

## Trial Arms Issues

### Distinguishing Between Branches and Transitions

Both the Branch and Transition columns contain rules, but the 2 columns represent 2 different types of rules. **Branch rules** represent forks in the trial flowchart, giving rise to separate arms. The rule underlying a branch appears in multiple records, once for each "fork" of the branch. **Transition rules** are used for choices within an arm. The value for TATRANS does contain a choice (an "if" clause). In Example Trial 4, subjects who receive 1, 2, 3, or 4 cycles of treatment A are all considered to belong to arm A.

### Subjects Not Assigned to an Arm

Some trial subjects may drop out of the study before they reach all of the branch points in the trial design. In the Demographics (DM) domain, the values of ARM and ARMCD must be supplied for such subjects, but the special values used for these subjects should not be included in the Trial Arms (TA) dataset; only complete arm paths should be described in the TA dataset. See DM Example 3 for how to represent ARM and ARMCD values for such trials.

### Defining Epochs

The series of examples for the TA dataset provides a variety of scenarios and guidance about how to assign epoch in those scenarios. In general, assigning epochs for blinded trials is easier than for unblinded trials. The blinded view of the trial will generally make the possible choices clear. For unblinded trials, the comparisons that will be made between arms can guide the definition of epochs.

### Rule Variables

The Branch and Transition columns shown in the example tables are variables with a Role of "Rule." The values of a Rule variable describe conditions under which something is planned to happen. At the moment, values of Rule variables are text. At some point in the future, it is expected that a mechanism to provide machine-readable rules will become available. Other Rule variables are present in the Trial Elements (TE) and Trial Visits (TV) datasets.
